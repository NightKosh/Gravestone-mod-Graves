For issues:
 * Be sure this is the same "graves" mod as you are using - sometimes I got bugs for another mods.(look at the graves pictures on my [site](http://gravestone.nightkosh.com/?page=about))
 * Try the latest version, it may have fixed the issue already.
 * If you crashed, please paste the crash log to [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and link it here, or at least past it directly to the issue and embrace by "```".
